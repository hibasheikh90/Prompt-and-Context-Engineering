# Advanced Prompting Strategies  


## 1. Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting  
Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex problems.

**Definition:**  
CoT helps AI solve problems by breaking them into small logical steps before giving the final answer.

**Example:**  
**Question:** If Ali has 3 boxes and each box has 4 apples, how many apples does he have in total?  
**Prompt:** “Let’s think step by step.”  
**Answer:**  
Step 1: Each box has 4 apples.  
Step 2: 3 × 4 = 12  
✅ **Final Answer:** Ali has 12 apples.

**When to Use:**  
- Math or logic questions  
- Multi-step reasoning  
- Complex analysis  

**Best Practices:**  
- Use “Let’s think step by step.”  
- Set temperature = 0 for consistency.  
- Extract the final answer separately from reasoning.

## 2. Self-Consistency Prompting  
Generate multiple reasoning paths and choose the most common result.

**Definition:**  
Self-Consistency checks answers from different reasoning paths and selects the most frequent or reliable one.

**Example:**  
**Question:** A shirt costs $100 and there’s a 10% discount. What’s the final price?  

**Path 1:** 10% of 100 = 10 → 100 - 10 = 90  
**Path 2:** Pay 90% of 100 = 0.9 × 100 = 90  
**Path 3:** Discount is $10 → 100 - 10 = 90  
✅ **Most common answer:** $90

**Explanation:**  
Self-Consistency reduces errors by comparing different reasoning paths and choosing the most frequent correct result.


# Step-Back Prompting  


## 🔍 What is Step-Back Prompting?
Step-Back Prompting means asking a **general question first** to get background knowledge before asking a **specific question**.  
It helps the AI think broadly before focusing on the exact problem.

---

## 🧩 Easy Example

### Step 1: General Question  
What are the key factors that affect good health?  
**Answer:** Exercise, diet, sleep, mental health.

### Step 2: Specific Question  
Using those factors, how can I improve my health as a student?  
**Answer:** Exercise daily for 30 minutes, eat balanced meals, sleep 7–8 hours, and manage study stress.

---

## 💡 When to Use  
- When solving **complex or applied problems**.  
- When you need to **build understanding step by step**.  
- When a **specific question depends on general principles**.

---

## 🏆 Benefits  
- Increases clarity and accuracy.  
- Ensures structured and logical responses.  
- Reduces the chance of missing important details.

---

## 🧠 Summary  
Step-Back Prompting helps the AI **think big first**, then **zoom in** to apply that understanding to your question.


# ReAct Prompting (Reasoning + Acting)  


## 🧠 What is ReAct Prompting?
ReAct stands for **Reasoning + Acting**.  
It’s a method where the AI **thinks logically (reasoning)** and then **takes an action** (like searching or calculating) to solve a problem step by step.  
This makes answers more accurate and realistic.

---

## 🔹 Simple Example

**Question:** What is the weather like in Karachi today?

**Thought:** I need to find the current weather data for Karachi.  
**Action:** Search “current weather in Karachi 2025”.  
**Observation:** The weather is 33°C and sunny.  
**Thought:** Okay, now I can describe it properly.  
**Final Answer:** The weather in Karachi today is sunny with a temperature of around 33°C.

---

## 💡 When to Use
- For **real-time information** (weather, population, prices, etc.)  
- For **multi-step reasoning** problems  
- For **research or analysis tasks**

---

## 🏆 Benefits
- Produces **accurate and fact-based** answers  
- Supports **step-by-step decision making**  
- Combines **logic + action** for better clarity

---

## 🧩 Summary
ReAct Prompting combines **Reasoning (thinking)** and **Acting (doing)** in a cycle:  

**Thought → Action → Observation → Final Answer**

Example pattern:
1. Think about what you need  
2. Take an action (like search)  
3. Observe the result  
4. Conclude with a clear final answer


# Tree of Thoughts (ToT)


## 🧠 What is Tree of Thoughts (ToT)?
Tree of Thoughts means exploring **multiple ideas or reasoning paths** before deciding which one is best.  
Just like a tree grows in different directions, this method helps in **thinking from many angles** and choosing the **strongest solution**.

---

## 🔹 Easy Example

**Question:** What’s the best way to study for exams?

### Branch 1: Study Alone
- **Pros:** Full focus, no distractions.  
- **Cons:** Can get boring, no one to discuss with.  
**Score:** 7/10  

### Branch 2: Group Study
- **Pros:** Learn faster through discussion, share ideas.  
- **Cons:** Can waste time if group is unserious.  
**Score:** 8/10  

### Branch 3: Online Study Resources
- **Pros:** Access to videos, quizzes, and notes anytime.  
- **Cons:** Needs internet, might lead to distractions.  
**Score:** 7.5/10  

### 🧩 Final Strategy
Combine **Group Study (Branch 2)** with **Online Resources (Branch 3)** for best results.

---

## 💡 When to Use
- For **creative problem-solving**  
- For **strategic planning or decision-making**  
- For **exploring multiple solutions**

---

## 🏆 Benefits
- Encourages creative and structured thinking  
- Helps evaluate pros and cons clearly  
- Leads to well-balanced, high-quality decisions

---

## 🧠 Summary
Tree of Thoughts helps you think like a tree 🌳 
Start from one idea (root), explore different solutions (branches), and choose the best combination (fruit 🍎).
