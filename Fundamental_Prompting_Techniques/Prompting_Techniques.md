# 📘 Fundamental Prompting Techniques (Easy Study Guide)

Prompting means **telling AI exactly what you want it to do**.  
If your question (prompt) is clear, the AI will give you a clear answer.  
Think of AI like a student answering an exam  your prompt is the question paper! ✏️

## 🧠 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

### 💡 What It Means:
You ask AI **directly** without giving any examples.

### 🧩 Example:
**Prompt:**  
Summarize this paragraph in one line:  
> “Artificial Intelligence helps machines learn from data and perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.”

**AI’s Answer:**  
AI helps machines learn and think like humans.

### ✅ When to Use:
- When the **question is simple**
- When AI already **understands the topic**

---

## 🧩 2. One-Shot Prompting

### 💡 What It Means:
You give **one example** to show AI how to format or answer your question.

### 🧩 Example:
**Prompt:**  
Summarize text in one sentence.

Example:  
Text: "Photosynthesis helps plants make food using sunlight."  
Summary: "Plants use sunlight to make food."

Now do this:  
Text: "The water cycle describes how water moves from the earth to the sky and back again."

**AI’s Answer:**  
"Water moves in a continuous cycle between the earth and the sky."

### ✅ When to Use:
- When you want AI to **follow your example format**
- When one example is enough to **show the pattern**

---

## 🔢 3. Few-Shot Prompting

### 💡 What It Means:
You give **2–5 examples** to teach AI the pattern before your actual question.

### 🧩 Example:
**Prompt:**  
Identify the **subject** and **verb** in each sentence.

Example 1: "Ali plays football." → Subject: Ali, Verb: plays  
Example 2: "Birds fly high." → Subject: Birds, Verb: fly  
Example 3: "The teacher explains the lesson." → Subject: The teacher, Verb: explains  

Now:  
"Students study hard."

**AI’s Answer:**  
Subject: Students, Verb: study ✅

### ✅ When to Use:
- When you need **pattern recognition** (like grammar, formatting, or classification)
- When the task needs **a few examples to understand**

---

## 🧭 4. System Prompting

### 💡 What It Means:
You tell AI **how it should behave** before asking a question.

### 🧩 Example:
**Prompt:**  
You are a **helpful study assistant**.  
Always give short and easy explanations suitable for school students.  

Question: What is a noun?

**AI’s Answer:**  
A noun is the **name of a person, place, thing, or idea**.  
Example: Ali, school, book, happiness.

### ✅ When to Use:
- When you want AI to **follow a specific teaching style**
- When you need **consistent educational answers**

---

## 👩‍🏫 5. Role Prompting

### 💡 What It Means:
You give AI a **role or identity** so it answers like an expert or teacher.

### 🧩 Example:
**Prompt:**  
Act as an **English teacher**.  
Explain the difference between **"is"** and **"are"** to a beginner student.

**AI’s Answer:**  
“Is” is used for **one person or thing** Example: *She is my friend.*  
“Are” is used for **more than one**  Example: *They are my friends.*

### ✅ When to Use:
- For **teaching, explaining, or tutoring tasks**
- When you want AI to **think like a teacher or expert**

---

## 🧩 6. Contextual Prompting

### 💡 What It Means:
You give **extra background information** (context) to help AI answer better.

### 🧩 Example:
**Prompt:**  
Context: You are writing for **school students (age 10–12)** learning about computers.  
Explain what “the Internet” is in a simple way.

**AI’s Answer:**  
The Internet is a network that connects computers all over the world 🌍.  
It helps people share information, watch videos, and send messages online.

### ✅ When to Use:
- When the **audience matters** (kids, students, professionals)  
- When you want **clear and focused** answers
